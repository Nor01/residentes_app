Residentes App description:

The world has access to information more and more thanks to the digital age. Currently seeks to carry out projects where the information may be required and available to everyone. A Despite this initiative, Honduras still carries out many of its processes in a traditional and nothing efficient. 

Although there are platforms and means for the control and administration of accesses to the residences these are static and ineffective for users. By creating a Mobile Application that facilitates both the Boards of Trustees and the Residents the process of Visit Control, Reception of Complaints, Payment Module, many barriers will be broken in the areas of monitoring and surveillance that will evolve more and more.

## Tech

Residentes App uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Laravel 9](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x) - Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax.
- [Laravel Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sanctum) - Laravel Sanctum offers this feature by storing user API tokens in a single database table and authenticating incoming HTTP requests via the Authorization header which should contain a valid API token.
- [MySQL](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/mysql-database/doc/getting-started.html) - MySQL Database Service is a fully managed Oracle Cloud Infrastructure native service, which automates tasks such as backup and recovery, and database and operating system patching.
- [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/) - Flutter is Googleâ€™s portable UI toolkit for crafting beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.

And of course Residentes App itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/Nor01/residentes_app) on GitHub.

## Installation

Residentes App requires [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#system-requirements), [Laravel 9](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x) and [PHP ^8.1.0](https://www.php.net/releases/8.1/en.php) to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd residentes_app
composer install
```

Create a `MySQL Database` name the database as **residentes_app_db** then:
```sh
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
```
The app will run by default on **http://localhost:8000** however to make some tests with the methods you will need to use postman as enviroment.

For testing `API Methods` using [POSTMAN :](https://www.postman.com/)

*`!important:` This information is for documentation only.*

> `GET` Method: `{{baseUrl}}`/api/v1/auth/residentes

> `POST` Method: `{{baseUrl}}`/api/v1/auth/logout

> `POST` Method: `{{baseUrl}}`/api/v1/register

> `POST` Method: `{{baseUrl}}`/api/v1/login

*login and register* are public methods, in order to use *logout and residentes* the user must be logged in, because the `${token}` is created and assigned once the user is register.
